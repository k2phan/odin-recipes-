    <p>
        This is a Mac and Cheese recipe that is everything you want in a knock-your-socks off Macaroni Cheese – cheesy and creamy, with perfectly cooked macaroni (no bloated pasta!), plenty of sauce and a crunchy buttery top (essential in my world!)
        
    </p>

    <h2>Ingridents</h2>
    <ol>8 oz macaroni (elbow pasta)</ol>
    <ol>1 tbsp (15g) unsalted butter (or 2 tsp oil)</ol>
    <ol>2/3 cup <strong>panko breadcrumbs</strong></ol>
    <ol>2 tbsp (30g) unsalted <strong>butter</strong></ol>
    <ol>1/4 tsp <strong>salt</strong></ol>
    <ol>2 cups freshly shredded cheese (gruyere,cheddar or colby)</ol>
    <ol>1 cup freshly shreadded <strong>mozzarella cheese</strong> </ol>
    <ol>1 tsp <strong>garlic powder</strong></ol>
    <ol>1/2 tsp <strong>onion powder</strong></ol>
    <ol>1/2 tsp <strong>mustard powder</strong></ol>

    <h2>Insturctions</h2>
    <ol>

    <p><li><strong>Cook pasta:</strong>Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add macaroni and cook per packet directions MINUS 1 minute.</li></p>
    <p><li><strong>Toss in butter: </strong>Drain, return pasta to pot, add butter and toss until melted. Set aside to cool while making the Sauce (Optional – Note 3).</li></p>
    <p><li><strong>Mix</strong> together Topping. Set aside.</li></p>
    <p><li><strong>Preheat oven</strong>> to 180°C/350°F (all oven types).</li></p>
    <p><li><strong>Make roux:</strong> In a large saucepan or in an ovenproof skillet (I use my 26cm/9" Lodge cast iron skillet), melt butter over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.</li></p>
    <p><li><strong>Add milk:</strong> Add about 1 cup of the milk and mix to dissolve the paste into the milk. Then add remaining milk and mix until lump free (use whisk if required).</li></p>
    <p><li><strong>Add Seasonings:</strong> Mix in salt and Seasonings if using.</li></p>
    <p><li><strong>Thicken sauce:</strong> Cook, stirring/whisking regularly, for 5 – 8 minutes until thickened to a cream consistency. When the Sauce coats the back of a wooden spoon, you should be able to draw a path with your finger.</li></p>
    <p><li><strong>Add cheese:</strong> Remove from stove, add cheese and stir – cheese doesn't need to melt.</li></p>
    <p><li><strong>Check salt:</strong> Adjust salt to taste (if you use recommended cheeses, you won't need more).</li></p>
    <p><li><strong>Assemble: </strong>Pour Sauce into pot with Macaroni. Stir quickly, then pour back into the skillet (I did this) or a baking dish (Note 4). Sprinkle with breadcrumb topping.</li></p>
    <p><li><strong>Bake</strong> for 25 minutes or until top is light golden. Don't bake too long otherwise you'll bake away the Sauce!</li></p>
    <p><li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve immediately! I sprinkled mine with a bit of fresh parsley. See notes for best make-ahead method.</li></p>
